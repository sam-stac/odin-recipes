    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Paneer Butter Masala recipe is a rich and creamy dish of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a tomato, butter and cashew sauce that is known here as “makhani gravy.” The acidity of the tomatoes and the sweetness of the cream make for a velvety, nearly addictive sauce. 
    </p>
    <p>    Also known as “Butter Paneer,” this yummy and popular vegetarian dish is derived from the recipe for Butter Chicken, a.k.a. Chicken Makhani, that I learned to make during my cooking school days. I know, I know, the thought of me cooking with meat sounds insane. It seems nearly a lifetime ago! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>

        <li>Raw Cashews</li>
            
        <li>Cream</li>
            
        <li>Butter</li>
            
        <li>Paneer</li>
            
        <li>Spices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry paneer in batches until golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer fried paneer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, retaining vegetable oil in skillet.
        <li>Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add ginger paste and garlic paste. Continue to cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Stir cashews, ground red chiles, cumin, coriander, and garam masala into the onion mixture. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir tomato sauce, half-and-half, milk, sugar, and salt into spice mixture; simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add fried paneer and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
